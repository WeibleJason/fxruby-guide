Other Sources of Information
============================

Books
-----

The best book on application development with Ruby and FXRuby is _FXRuby: Create Lean and Mean GUIs with Ruby_,
by Lyle Johnson, published by the Pragmatic Programmers. The following Ruby books also contain sections on FXRuby:

 * _The Ruby Way_, by Hal Fulton.
 * _Ruby Developer's Guide_, by Michael Neumann, Robert Feldt and Lyle Johnson.

Reference Documentation
-----------------------

The current [FXRuby API Reference Documentation](http://www.fxruby.org/doc/api) is a work in progress, but serves as a pretty good guide to the available
methods and attributes for the different classes. The regular [FOX](http://www.fox-toolkit.org/) API Reference Documentation can be used as a fallback
source of information, although it is intended for users of the C++ library.

Web Sites
---------

The [FOX toolkit home page](http://www.fox-toolkit.org/)
is still one of the best places to find information about GUI programming
with FOX. This is the site maintained by Jeroen van der Zijp, the creator
and primary developer of FOX, and serves as the official download site for
the FOX library. In addition to a number of articles about programming
with FOX, you'll find links to projects using FOX. A newer web site,
the [FOX Community Wiki](http://www.fox-toolkit.net/), is
maintained by Sander Jansen. Like most Wiki sites, the information here is
a little more scattered but tends to be more up-to-date than some
information on the main FOX site. This site includes a number of tutorial
articles, as well as "cookbook" and "how-to" pages on many
topics.
